<h1>Flappy Bird</h1>
This project has been developed to create a custom version of the popular Flappy Bird game using the Unity game engine. The game is a simple side-scrolling experience where the player controls a bird, making it fly by tapping or clicking to avoid obstacles.

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The player can control the bird's ascent by tapping or pressing a designated key.</li>
  <li>The game world is infinite, with obstacles randomly generated.</li>
  <li>The game keeps track of the player's progress, including the number of obstacles cleared and the highest score achieved.</li>
  <li>Colliding with obstacles results in game over, displaying the player's score.</li> 
</ul>

<h3>How To Play</h3>
<ol>
  <li>When the game starts, the bird automatically begins to move.</li>
  <li>The player can make the bird ascend by tapping or performing the designated key press.</li>
  <li>The bird rises as a result of the taps or key presses, navigating through the gaps between obstacles.</li>
  <li>The player's objective is to keep the bird alive for as long as possible by avoiding collisions with obstacles.</li>
  <li>When the bird collides with an obstacle, the game ends, and the player's score is displayed.</li>
</ol>
